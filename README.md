# About the book
Three years ago we spoke to several animation makers in the industry for a small demo video we wanted for our product. With quotes expecting no less than $10,000 for a ninety second (minimum length for business) animation we were left with only two choices for our startup: Put our hearts back in a bag and go for a simple screencast or do an animation ourselves.

We didn't want a dull screencast and obviously we didn't have that kind of money either, so we decided to do animation. For they say, when you're stuck between a cliff and a hard rock it's time to go ahead and make your own plane.

So here's how we made it — an exact sixty second animation for our little letter-writing app then. While the app didn't survive after 2013 the video and the spirit behind it still carries on.

This book has been published using the notes we took in 2012. We've used [Bookiza](https://github.com/bookiza/bookiza) to create the book and publish it here. The source of the book is available under MIT license. Hope you like it!

# Tools 
Much of this book was written using plain old HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used my existing tool-chain, GIT, Sublime, Nodejs and quite a bit of Codepen.io to develop and test the pages of the book.
