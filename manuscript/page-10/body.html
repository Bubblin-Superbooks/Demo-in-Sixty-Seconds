    <h1> Music is the soul</h1>
    <p> Good music is crucial. It is the soul of your animation. </p>
    <p> Unless you decide to use a voice-over, music will impart ambience to the story of your animation. Also it will be much tolerable during animation making when you have to listen to it over and over again.</p>
