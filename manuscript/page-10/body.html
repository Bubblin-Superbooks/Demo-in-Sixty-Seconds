    <h1> Music is the soul</h1>
    <p> Good music is crucial. It is the soul of your video. Unless you decide to use a voice-over, music will give an ambience to the story of your animation. Also, it will be much tolerable during animation-making when the same piece is to be listened to over and over again.</p>
