        <p> Short. Ask anyone, short is sexy. </p>
        <p>
            It is important to keep the length of your video short. In fact, keep it shortest <em>possible</em>, preferably between 30 seconds or a minute. 90 at most.
        </p>
        <p>We kept the length of our animation at 60 seconds exactly. </p>
        <p> Why did we do this? Because it is hard to hold the attention of a viewer for more than a few secondsâ€”first three or four is all we have to hook the viewer for the rest of the story. </p>
        <p> A short video (say 60 seconds) will help you bring out the most valuable aspect of your offerings to the front. And do so in a clever catch-ey way. Help you channelize all your energy in showing only what's relevant to your target audience. </p>
