    <h1> Long or short?</h1>
    <p> Short. Ask anyone, short is sexy. </p>
    <p> Misogyny aside, it is important to keep the length of your video short. In fact, keep it the shortest <em>possible</em>. 30 seconds or a minute. 90 seconds at the most. 
    </p>
    <p>We decided to keep the length of our animation at 60 seconds exactly. </p>
    <p> Why so? It is hard to hold the attention of a viewer for more than a few seconds â€” first three or four seconds is all you have in which your video must hook the viewer for the rest of the story. </p>
    <p> A short video (say 60 seconds) will help you bring out the most valuable aspect of your offerings to the front. And do so in a clever catch-ey way. Help you channelize all your energy in showing only what's relevant to your target audience. </p>
