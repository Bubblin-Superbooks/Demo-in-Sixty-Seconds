    <h1> Long short?</h1>
    <p>Short is sexy. Ask anyone.</p>
    <p> Apart from freezing the length of your animation it is better to try and keep it short as well. Under a minute or two. </p> <p> It is hard to hold attention of the viewer for more than a few seconds — first five or ten odd seconds — the window in which your animation must engage and hook the viewer for the rest of the story. </p>
    <p> A short sixty second video will help you bring the most valuable aspect of your product to the front. Connect with the audience right away. </p>
    <p> It will help you put all your energy on a smaller surface area and show what's relevant. </p>
