    <h1> Long short?</h1>
    <p>Short is sexy. Ask anyone.</p>
    <p> Apart from freezing the length of your animation it is also better to keep it short. Under a minute or two. </p>
    <p> It is hard to hold the attention of a viewer for more than a few seconds — first five or ten seconds are all you got — the window in which your animation must engage and hook the viewer for the rest of the story. </p>
    <p> A short sixty second video will help you bring the most valuable aspect of your product to the front. Connect with the audience right away. It will help you put all your energy on a smaller surface area and show what's relevant. </p>
