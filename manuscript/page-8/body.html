    <h1> Long short?</h1>
    <p>Short is sexy. Ask anyone.</p>
    <p> Apart from freezing the length of animation it is imperative to also keep it short. Between a minute or two at most. We chose to do 60 seconds only. </p>
    <p> It is hard to hold attention of a viewer for more than a few seconds — first three or four seconds is all you got — in which your animation must hook the viewer for the rest of the story. </p>
    <p> A short sixty second video will help you bring the most valuable aspect of your offerings to the front, channelize all energy in bringing that information to the audience right away. Show only what's relevant. </p>
