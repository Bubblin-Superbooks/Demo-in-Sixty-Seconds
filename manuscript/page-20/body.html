    <p> Most of our sketching & artwork was done using plain old paper & pencil. Later we scanned up the artwork and retraced the outlines using a cheap Wacom <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets">Pentablet</a>. It cost us $99, the only
      dollar we spent for this video. </p>
    <p>For animation we used Adobe Flash CS5 but sadly Flash is dying. There is <a href="https://www.toonboom.com/">ToonBoom</a> if you're looking for an alternative. We also used Adobe After Effects for coloring and finishing touches.</p>
    <p> Let's not go into a rigorous tutorial on how to use Flash CS5 in this book but there is a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mupkhM1LUo">tutorial</a> on YouTube that we relied on heavily.</p>
