    <p> We did most of our sketching & artwork on plain good paper with a pencil. But you can use <a href="http://www.storyboardthat.com/">software</a> for it too. Later we scanned up our artwork and retraced the outlines using a cheap Wacom <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets">Pen-Tablet</a>.
      It cost us $99, the only dollar we spent for this video. </p>
    <p>For animation we used Adobe Flash CS5 but sadly Flash is dying. There is <a href="https://www.toonboom.com/">ToonBoom</a> if you're looking for an alternative. We also used Adobe After Effects for coloring and finishing touches.</p>
    <p> Let's not go into a rigorous tutorial on how to use Flash CS5 in this book but there is a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mupkhM1LUo">tutorial</a> on YouTube that we relied on heavily.</p>
