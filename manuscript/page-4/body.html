            Before we dive into animation-making for your product here's our quintessential piece of advice:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
            Don't do classical animation by yourself.
            </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Yes. Don't do it if you've been a hacker or manager all your life. Try a screencast instead or find an artist who can do it for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's a little fact about our excursion into hand-made animation: In the hindsight we concluded that it was a reckless decision. Especially, because we hadn't drawn an apple since our first grade.
        </p>
        <p> We really mean this. Sincerely. </p>
