        <p>
            Before you dive into animation-making for a demo of your startup product here's our first advice:
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though we were able to reach a meaningful end with our little excursion into hand-made animation in the hindsight it feels the decision was reckless. Reckless especially when we hadn't drawn an apple since the first grade. </p>
        <p>No really, avoid if you can. </p>
        <p>
            Animation is hard. <em> Really </em>hard. It's a complete no-go if you've been a hacker or manager all your life. Do a screencast instead or find an artist who can do it for you in your budget.
