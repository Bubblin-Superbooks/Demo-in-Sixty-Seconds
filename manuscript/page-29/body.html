    <h1>Compositing</h1>
    <p> Compositing means combining different visual and aural elements of the animation together and packaging them into a nice and polished singular offering. It involves applying color correction techniques, applying filters, sounds editing, balancing hues and saturation etc. </p>
    <p>Compositing takes a lot of time even though it's just about finishing touches and improvements. It makes the video production-ready. </p>
