    <h1>[ Animation is hard ]</h1>
    <p class="justify">Although we did reach a meaningful end with our little excursion into hand made animation, in the hindsight it feels rather reckless for having taken it up in the first place. Especially, when we hadn't drawn an apple since our first grade. But it was fun.</p>
    <p class="justify"> So if we're to give a succinct tip on this one: ANIMATION IS HARD. If you've been a hacker or a manager all your life, better hire an artist to do it for you. </p>
