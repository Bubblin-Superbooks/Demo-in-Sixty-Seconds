    <h1>Must avoid</h1>
    <p> Your product features are nobody's problem. </p>
    <p> Remember, donâ€™t just start yelling out all the features of your product in your video. It sucks. People hate it when entrepreneurs go turnips about some feature or a list of things. </p>
    <p>Just show one basic value of your video that solves something for someone (the target customer) in your video. And then run! </p>
    <p> People love that. </p>
