    <h1>The highs & the lows</h1>
    <p> Observe the effect of music on your animation. Loop the audio over your timeline and animate according to the lows and highs of music. If you are making a cut or changeover from one scene to another use a fade-in or a fade-out to transition; like
      you'd do with CSS3 or jQuery. </p>
    <p> Remember, do not spend too much time on the details. Do not get mired up with something that draws your attention towards itself. Finish all the keyframes first and then fill in the complete story of your animation in between. Improve upon it in iterations. </p>
    <p> Another tip here is to consider adding sounds of the environment to your video. A simple mouse click or the sound of a camera shutter or a mail ding adds magic to animation. We added a couple of interesting sounds to our video. Observe the mouse click at the end of the
      video. Does it not complete the video itself? </p>
