    <h1> Take references</h1>
    <p> Reality is impressive. Notice how often Hollywood movies are inspired from true events? How it makes complete sense to ground the story to some context of reality so that people can relate to it. Take references for your animation. It is much easier
      to draw artwork when you have some visual cues and outlines to work with. </p>
    <p> For example, we shot the first scene of our animation using Paris's skyline using this picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris#/media/File:Sacre_Coeur_seen_from_Ard_de_Triomphe.jpg"> Sacre Coeur</a>. Just a few
      rough outlines without any color or detail. </p>
