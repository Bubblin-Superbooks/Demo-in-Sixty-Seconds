    <p> Reality is impressive. Noticed how often movies are inspired from true life events at real places? It makes complete sense to ground your story to some context of reality somewhere. That makes people relate to your animation better. Also it is easier
      to draw such artwork as well. </p>
    <p> For example, we drew the outline of our first scene in Paris using this picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris#/media/File:Sacre_Coeur_seen_from_Ard_de_Triomphe.jpg"> Sacre Coeur</a>. Just a few rough outlines
      without any color or detail. Our introduction scene uses a pan of Paris's skyline using this inspiration.</p>
