    <h1> Take references</h1>
    <p> Reality is very impressive. Take references for your animation from some real setting. Notice how often Hollywood movies are inspired from true life events at real places? How those unusual moments from places engage people because they're in awe of it.  </p>
    <p> For example, we shot the first scene of our animation using Paris's skyline using this picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris#/media/File:Sacre_Coeur_seen_from_Ard_de_Triomphe.jpg"> Sacre Coeur</a>. It made our lives easier to the point of simply picking up outlines of a coloring book. </p>
