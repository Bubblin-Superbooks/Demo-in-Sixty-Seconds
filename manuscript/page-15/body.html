        <h1> Take references</h1>
        <p> Take references for your animation from some real places. Notice how often Hollywood movies are inspired from true life events of real people in those places? Those mundane bits from places and cultures engage people easily. For example, we shot the first scene using Paris's skyline using this picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris#/media/File:Sacre_Coeur_seen_from_Ard_de_Triomphe.jpg"> Sacre Coeur</a>. Simple line tracing! </p>
