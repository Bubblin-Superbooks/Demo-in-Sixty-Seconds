        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p>
            It is a chicken and egg problem when you're starting out on a new video. Should the story be frozen first or one could start with something else -- something that you're good at already. </p>
        <p>
            Professionals try to freeze the story first. But that's the difference -- they're professionals. And can draw up characters and direct the scene to match the storyline.
        </p>
        <p>
            In your case this approach will not work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why so? Because terrible drawing and animation skills! Zero experience in direction and poor visibility on piecing out scenes correctly, one after the other to map the whole story. </p>
