        <h1> Chicken or egg? </h1>
        <p>
            It is always a <em> chicken </em> or egg problem when starting out on a new animation project. Should the story come first or the characters its key scenes? </p>
        <p>
            Professional artists freeze the story first. But there's the key difference -- they're professionals. And can draw characters and scenes and direct their hands to follow a storyline.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our case this approach did not work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why so? Because terrible drawing and animation skills! Zero experience in direction and poor visibility on piecing out scenes correctly, one after the other to map the whole story. </p>
