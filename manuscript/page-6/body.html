        <h1> Chicken or egg? </h1>
        <p>
            The question is: Where to start? It is always this <em> chicken </em> (not chick) or egg problem when starting out on a new animation. Should the story come first or the flow of animation with its key scenes? </p>
        <p>
            Professional artists freeze the story first. But that's also the key differenceâ€”they're professionals afterall! They can draw characters and scenes using free hand and follow any storyline accurately. You and I cannot draw like that.

            So we took a different route for our animation.

        <p>
            Need more explanation?: Well, because we're terrible at drawing and animation skills and have zero experience in handling video/audio direction that is compounded by our sorry visual storytelling skills.

        <p> We chose music first. </p>
