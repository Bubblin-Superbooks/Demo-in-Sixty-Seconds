        <h1>Character making</h1>
        <p> Character is the context of your story. It is probably a good idea to model the character of your animation after your ideal customer. If your free hand permits, that is. The animation will appeal and influence the right segment of users. An important tip here is to <em>not</em> have more than one character in your animation. We initially had three ourselves but soon realized that it'd be difficult to handle all of them. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/Demo-in-Sixty-Seconds/master/assets/images/characters.jpg" width="100%" /> </div>
