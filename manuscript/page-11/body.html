    <h1>Character building</h1>
    <p> Now that we've music in place (and a fixed timeline) it is time to try some hand with pencil and paper. Try and draw some sketches. Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet here to help you get started on sketching. Youâ€™ll have to try drawing funny
      faces several times and then pick a style that works for you. </p>
    <p> Character is the context of your story. It is a good idea to model the character of your animation after your ideal customer. That is how your video will appeal to and influence the right segment of users. An important tip here is to <em>not</em>      have more than one character in your animation. We initially had three ourselves but soon realized that it'd be difficult to handle all of them. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/Demo-in-Sixty-Seconds/master/images/characters.jpg"
