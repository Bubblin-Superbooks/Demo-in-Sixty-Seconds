        <h1> Music first </h1>
        <p> We chose music first and you should also probably do that. It helped us a lot. I froze the length (duration) of our animation to exactly 60 seconds. And pushed us to optimize everything else i.e. story, scenes, characters, motion rate and flow within this time limit. </p>
        <p>Freezing music first works just like the 140 characters limit on Twitter. How it pushes people to communicate sharply. </p>
        <p>Note, for every extra second we add in to the animation there will be at least 24 additional frames to work on later. You probably don't want to lose all your energy before finishing the project.</p>
