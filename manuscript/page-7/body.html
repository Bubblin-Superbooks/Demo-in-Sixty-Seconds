        <h1> Music first </h1>
        <p>Take our advice: Choose music first. </p>
        <p> It will help you freeze the length (duration) of the animation. Did in our case! And push you to optimize everything else i.e. story, scenes, characters, actions and motion rate within that time limit. </p>
        <p>This works like Twitter. Now how the 140 characters limit pushes people to optimize and write their messages sharply. </p>
        <p>Also, for every extra second added to the animation there will be at least 24 additional frames to work on. You probably don't want to lose all your energy before finishing the project.</p>
