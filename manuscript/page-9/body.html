    <h1> A melodious potion</h1>
    <p>A nice melodious piece of music works like a potion on the senses. It sets the mood for viewers. Spend some time <a href="10" class="page">searching</a> the right piece for your animation. Keep at least 2-3 tracks at hand so that you can ditch
      and fallback to another in on the last minute. </p>
    <p>In our animation we wanted a warm retro-feel because our app was all about handwritten letters. We shortlisted a few compositions with a comfortable feel and finally chose <a href="http://www.purple-planet.com/#/preview-parisian-waltz/4539564511">Parisian Waltz</a> for our project. </p>
    <p> Actually, we dug a little deeper than that. It made sense to use a song on a more commonly heard Ionian mode or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale">diatonic major scale</a>. The Ionian mode has a happy-go-easy feel to it and
      is known to make the listeners feel happy. The slow paced measure and the simple G-C-D-Am chord pattern made Parisian Waltz a good choice for us to work with. </p>
