    <h1>Mid-course tip</h1>
    <p> Since you're neckdeep into your animation now, a word of advice here: Do not dig yourself too much into details in the very beginning. For instance, you don't have to color or polish the Introduction scene/pan until you have done the entire story
      (full sixty seconds) on your Flash project. </p>
    <p>It may so happen that after you complete the last (outro) scene, you'll find that the first (intro) scene or a part of the mid-story is completely out of place. And could be done away with. This happened to us!</p>
    <p> You don't want to regret about spending too much time on a part that you'd eventually not use. So focus on completing a full round of animation first. And focus on adding details later on. </p>
