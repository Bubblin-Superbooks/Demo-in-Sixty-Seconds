    <h1>Screencast vs. Animation</h1>
    <p> Doing a screencast is certainly much easier. If you're finding it hard to sketch with free hand then you should probably do a screencast. You're going to need a pleasantly recorded voice-over that explains your product for your screencast. </p>
    <p>
    Even with animation you could use a voice-over but speech generally tends to sway the attention of the viewer from what the character is doing to what the character is saying. It can twist the purpose of animation. So choose wisely.</p>
