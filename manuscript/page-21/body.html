        <h1> Panning & Immersion </h1>
        <p>Remember we have only the first few seconds to hook a viewer. Panning and immersion is a great way to do that. Observe this animation by Claude Medori, for example: </p>
        <div class="videoWrapper">
            <!-- Copy & Pasted from Vimeo -->
            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/71502546?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

            It uses a pan to immerse the viewer. You'll often find this kind of camera trick being used in Hollywood flicks where you as a viewer are placed into the story, location and situation through a surreal motion of camera. Secret sauce!</p>
