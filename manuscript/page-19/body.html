    <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
    <p> A lot of online tutorials start from here, for storyboarding is generally the first step if you're into professional animation making. Once a story is finalized it is time to draw sketches of it. Storyboarding is all about drawing rough sketches (or scenes
      or keyframes) that are 5 to 10 seconds apart. These sketches/keyframes describe the progression of your story like  a flowchart in the world of software. </p>
    <p> Storyboard will give you a feel of the flow in a series of visual stops. It will then directly map onto the timeline of your project (on Adobe Flash or any other animation software). We used pen and paper to storyboard but there is <a href="http://www.storyboardthat.com/">software</a>      to do that as well. </p>
    <p>Some of the immediate benefits of storyboarding are that it will give some shape to your thoughts and help others visualize it too. Make way for inputs from them. It will split the project into smaller chewable chunks or milestones against which you
      can track your progress. </p>
    <p> Storyboarding will also help you assimilate other elements of your video, such as considering the movement of camera, behavior of characters and placement of other objects on the stage etc. Ideally, you'd want to break sixty seconds down into three equal parts of twenty second each: And call your sprints an introduction, a mid-course and an outro. </p>
