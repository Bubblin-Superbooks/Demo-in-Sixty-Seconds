        <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
        <p> Storyboarding will help you assimilate other elements of your video: Such as considering the movement of camera, behavior of characters and placement of other silly objects on the stage etc. Ideally, you'd want to break down your sixty seconds animation into three equal parts and work in sprints for each part: Introduction, mid-course and the outro. </p>
        <p> A lot of online tutorials start with storyboarding because it is usually the first step for professional animators. Once a story is frozen the idea is expand on the story with visuals / rough sketches (or scenes or keyframes) that are 5 to 10 seconds apart. These keyframes describe the progression of the story. Just like a flowchart. </p>
        <p> Some of the immediately visible benefits of storyboarding are that it gives shape to thoughts early on and helps others on the team to visualize it as well. Makes way for inputs from others.  </p>
