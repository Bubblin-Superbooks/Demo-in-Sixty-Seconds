        <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
        <p> Storyboarding will help you assimilate other elements of your animation: movement of camera, behavior of characters, placement of other objects on stage etc. Ideally, you'd want to break your sixty seconds animation down to three parts of 20 second each or sprints: an introduction, a mid-course and the outro. </p>
        <p> You'll note that a lot of online tutorials start with storyboarding as it is the first step for professional animators too. Once a story is frozen the idea is to visualize the flow of story with rough sketches (scenes or keyframes) that are 5 to 10 seconds apart. These keyframes describe the progression of the story. Like a flowchart. Some of the immediate benefits of storyboarding are that it gives shape to placcid thoughts early on and helps others on the team to visualize as well. Makes way for inputs from others.  </p>
