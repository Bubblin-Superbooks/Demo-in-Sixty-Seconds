    <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
    <p> A lot of online tutorials start from here, for storyboarding is usually the first step for professional animator. Once a story is finalized it is time to draw sketches of it to storyboard it. Storyboarding is all about drawing rough sketches (or scenes
      or keyframes) that are 5 to 10 seconds apart. These keyframes describe the progression of the story like a flowchart. </p>
    <p> Storyboard will give you a feel of the animation in a series of visual stops. It maps directly to the timeline of your project (on Adobe Flash or any other animation software). Some of the immediate benefits of storyboarding are that it gives shape
      to your thoughts and helps others to visualize it as well. Makes way for inputs from the team. It splits the project into smaller chewable chunks or milestones against which you can track progress. </p>
    <p> Storyboarding also helps you assimilate other elements of your video, such as considering the movement of camera, behavior of characters and placement of other objects on the stage etc. Ideally, you'd want to break down your sixty seconds animation
      into three equal parts: And call the sprints an introduction, a mid-course and an outro. </p>
