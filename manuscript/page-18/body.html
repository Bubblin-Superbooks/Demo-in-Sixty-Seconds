    <h1>A simple story</h1>
    <p> Don’t think up a complicated story to begin with. Start with a simple idea and break it down further into smaller parts. Focus exactly on how your product story will fit into the lives of people. Give that story to your animation character. See how
      it works. </p>
    <p> It is probably a good idea to have 2-3 short story ideas that will explain and appeal to the target audience. But it keeping it simple and non-rigid is extremely important. </p>
    <p> It'd not be possible to pull off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM6cLnscmO8">Disney</a> in the first animation itself — nor is it necessary — so do what is simple and appropriate at your skill level. For example, stick to 2D animation
      because 3D is going to be way too hard to begin with. Stick to stick-characters if that works for you.</p>
