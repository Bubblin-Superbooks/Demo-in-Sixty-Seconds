    <h1>Follow your hand</h1>
    <p>When it comes to sketching and drawing, the best way to do it is to follow your hand. It's unlikely that as first-timers you (or I) would be able to draw systematically and produce a scene as imagined in the head. We're not trained for that. But don't
      worry about it. Goof around a bit. </p>
    <p> In fact the more you have fun with it, the better it gets. Do not dig yourself too deep with a story that you'd planned for. It may not work out that way. </p>
    <p> Strange as it may sound, our hands automatically led us to the current story of our animation. We had a different version of it on our minds when we started working on it. But the characters behaved horribly when we forced them to follow a rigid story.
      It now feels almost deliberate that the brush wouldn't go where we wanted it to. It led us all the way.</p>
    <p> So relax if things aren't taking shape the way you expected them to. Have fun. Lose yourself and follow your hand instead. </p>
