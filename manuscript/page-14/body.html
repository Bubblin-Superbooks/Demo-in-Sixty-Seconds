    <h1>Follow your hand</h1>
    <p>When it comes to sketching and painting the best way to go forward is to go with the <em>flow</em>. Follow your hand. It's unlikely that as first-timers you (and I) will be able to draw systematically and produce a scene just as imagined in the head.
      We're not trained for that. So don't worry about it, goof around as much as you can until you're comfortable. </p>
    <p> In fact the more fun you have with it the better it gets. Do not dig yourself too deep with a rigid & planned story, for it will not work out that way. </p>
    <p> Strange as it may sound, our hands automatically led us to the current story of our animation. We had a different version of it when we started out but then the characters took form and forced us away from the original score. It now feels as if it
      was deliberate that the brush didn't go where we wanted it to.</p>
    <p> The hand had its own story to tell. </p>
