        <h1>Follow your hand</h1>
        <p>When it comes to sketching and coloring the best way to go forward is to follow the hand. It is very unlikely that you (and I) as first-timers will be able to draw anything systematically. We can't produce a scene imagined in our heads. We're not trained for that. </p>
        <p>
            Worry not! Goof around as much as you can until you're comfortable with a style of your own. In fact the more fun you have with it, the better it gets. Do not force yourself along a rigid storyline because the drawings will not work out that way. </p>
        <p> Strange as it may sound, our hands automatically led us to the current story of our animation. We had a different version of it when we started out but then the characters took form and forced us away from the original score. </p>
        <p> It now feels as if the hand had its own story to tell. </p>
